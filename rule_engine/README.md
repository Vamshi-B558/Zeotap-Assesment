---Project Structure---

This project consists of the following main components:

Flask API (app.py): Serves as the backend to receive rules and attributes via REST endpoints.

AST (ast.py): Implements an Abstract Syntax Tree to structure and evaluate rules.

Rule Parser (rule_parser.py): Parses rule strings into AST nodes.

Rule Combiner (rule_combiner.py): Combines multiple rules into a single logical rule.

Rule Evaluator (rule_evaluator.py): Evaluates the combined rules against provided attributes.

MySQL Database: Stores rule definitions and attributes, accessed through SQL queries.

Testing and Documentation:

Postman: For testing endpoints.

Package Explanations
Flask: Web framework for handling HTTP requests. Install via pip install flask.
jsonify: Converts Python dictionaries to JSON format for API responses.
MySQL Connector (e.g., mysql-connector-python): Facilitates communication with the MySQL database.

Development and Explanation
AST Design (in ast.py):
The Node class represents nodes in the AST, including operators (e.g., AND, OR) and operands (e.g., age > 30).
Nodes are combined to form a logical rule structure for evaluation.

Rule Parsing (in rule_parser.py):

The RuleParser class parses rule strings, converting them into Node objects for the AST. You’ll refine the parsing logic to support additional operators as needed.

Rule Combining (in rule_combiner.py):

The RuleCombiner class aggregates individual rules with logical operators like AND/OR, simplifying rule structure.
Evaluation (in rule_evaluator.py):

The RuleEvaluator class accepts rules and attributes, applying logical checks and returning whether the input meets specified conditions.

Database (MySQL):

Store rules and attributes for reuse and scalability. Ensure proper indexing for performance with frequently accessed columns.

Testing and Packaging

Postman Testing:
Create tabbed requests to test each endpoint individually (create, evaluate, etc.).

Performance:

For real-time evaluation, ensure efficient rule parsing and caching of common rules.
Optimize database queries to reduce lookup times for complex rule sets.

Packaging

Packaging:
Organize modules and scripts in folders (e.g., rule_engine/). Add __init__.py files to make each folder a package.
Specify dependencies in requirements.txt for easy installation.

Here’s a simplified explanation that focuses on how your project works, the purpose of each part, and how it’s used, in a way that would be clear for non-technical audiences like an HR representative.

Project Overview
Your project is a Rule Engine application. This software evaluates business rules (or conditions) that companies might set up. For example, “Is an employee eligible for a bonus?” or “Does this applicant meet the criteria for a job?”

How It Works
Receiving Rules and Data:

Users send “rules” (conditions, like "age > 30") and “data” (facts, like a person’s age) to the software through an interface.
Example: The rule might be "Only employees older than 30 in the Sales department can receive a bonus." The data might be “Employee age = 32, Department = Sales.”
Checking the Rule:

The Rule Engine reads this rule and breaks it down into a structure it can understand, using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Think of the AST as a map of the rule that tells the system what needs to be checked.
Example: It would map out that “age > 30” is one condition, and “Department = Sales” is another, combining them with an “AND” requirement (both conditions must be true).
Evaluating the Data:

The system then compares the data with each condition in the rule.
Example: For an employee who is 32 years old and works in Sales, the system would confirm they meet the rule’s conditions.
Returning the Result:

If the employee meets the rule’s conditions, the Rule Engine would return a positive result (True). If not, it would return a negative result (False).
